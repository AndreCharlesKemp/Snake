1. Rules of Snake

This classic snake derivative is very close to the original.
Point are earned by consuming green dots.
Each time a green dot is consumed the score will increase and the snake will grow by one segment.
When the snake reaches a predetermined length the speed of the game will increase.
To decrease the speed a red dot can be consumed, this will cause the snake to lose one segment.
But be careful, consuming a red dot when the snake has only one segment will mean an immediate
Game Over!
The game will also end as soon as the snake come into contact with any of the sides of the board or
with its own body.
